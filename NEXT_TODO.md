# NEXT TODO: Analyze Core Library + Device Code Together

## User's Feedback
As I read your suggestions more closely, you are making suggestions based on assumptions from the code you see. I have a complementary library that manages many of the issues you are raising. I have many "Zed" sensors that share a common over-arching codebase. The Zed projects are hardware and design specific. The question is, how do I allow you to have access to both folders at the same time so you can evaluate the code of both the core library and the device-specific code?

## Claude's Response
You're absolutely right - I was analyzing this in isolation without seeing the broader Zennora ecosystem. The suggestions I made likely duplicate functionality already in your core library.

To analyze both codebases together, you have a few options:

**Option 1: Symbolic Links**
```bash
ln -s /path/to/ZennoraVessel/lib ./core-lib
```
This creates a link so I can read both directories from this project.

**Option 2: Change Working Directory**
I could work from a parent directory that contains both projects:
```bash
cd /Users/mauricetamman/Documents/PlatformIO/Projects/
```
Then access both `ZedSwitch12vFS-260/` and `ZennoraVessel/` simultaneously.

**Option 3: Use Task Tool**
I can use the Task tool to search across your entire PlatformIO Projects directory to understand the relationship between the core library and device-specific implementations.

I notice in your `platformio.ini` you reference:
```
lib_extra_dirs = /Users/mauricetamman/Documents/PlatformIO/Projects/ZennoraVessel/lib
```

Which approach would you prefer? This would help me give much more targeted suggestions that don't duplicate your existing core functionality and focus on what's actually missing or could be improved in the device-specific implementation.

## Next Steps
- Choose approach for accessing both codebases
- Re-analyze code improvements with full context
- Focus on device-specific improvements vs core library functionality

## Context Notes
- Current analysis was done on device-specific code only
- Core library path: `/Users/mauricetamman/Documents/PlatformIO/Projects/ZennoraVessel/lib`
- Need to understand what's already implemented in core vs what needs device-specific work
- Previous improvement suggestions (Issues #1-10) may need revision after seeing full context
